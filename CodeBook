"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. "

                                                Data Process Procedure
1. Download the original dataset from this site: 
    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
2. Unzip package to a subfolder called "data".
3. Load the following six files to R: "subject_test.txt", "X_test.txt", "y_test.txt", "subject_train.txt", "X_train.txt" and "y_train.txt"
4. Join the three test datasets by column: "subject_test.txt", "X_test.txt" and "y_test.txt". Same for the three train dataset.
5. Join the test data set and train data set by row.
6. Load "features.txt" file. It includes all the measured variable names for the dataset in step 5. 
7. Select variable names with "mean" or "std". Subset the dataset in step 5 by column according to the selected variable names.
8. Load "activity_labels.txt" file. Merge it with the main dataset. It added a column with real activity name.
9. Rename all colmuns with more descriptive names. Using the existing variable names in "features.txt" for all the measurement data variables.
10.Summarize the dataset by take average of each measurement variable for each activity and each subject. Save it to"final_tidy_data.csv".
